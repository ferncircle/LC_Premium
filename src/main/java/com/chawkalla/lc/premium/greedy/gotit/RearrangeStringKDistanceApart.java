/**
 *https://leetcode.com/problems/rearrange-string-k-distance-apart/#/description
 *
 *Given a non-empty string s and an integer k, rearrange the string such that the same characters are at least distance k from 
 *each other.

All input strings are given in lowercase letters. If it is not possible to rearrange the string, return an empty string "".

Example 1:
s = "aabbcc", k = 3

Result: "abcabc"

The same letters are at least distance 3 from each other.
Example 2:
s = "aaabc", k = 3 

Answer: ""

It is not possible to rearrange the string.
Example 3:
s = "aaadbbcc", k = 2

Answer: "abacabcd"

Another possible answer is: "abcabcda"

The same letters are at least distance 2 from each other.

The greedy algorithm is that in each step, select the char with highest remaining count if possible (if it is not in the 
waiting queue). PQ is used to achieve the greedy. A regular queue waitQueue is used to "freeze" previous appeared char 
in the period of k.

In each iteration, we need to add current char to the waitQueue and also release the char at front of the queue, put 
back to maxHeap. The "impossible" case happens when the maxHeap is empty but there is still some char in the waitQueue.*
