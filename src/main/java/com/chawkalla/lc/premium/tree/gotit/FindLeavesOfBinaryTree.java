/**
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/find-leaves-of-binary-tree/#/description
 * 
 * Given a binary tree, collect a tree's nodes as if you were doing this: Collect and remove all leaves, repeat until the tree is empty.

Example:
Given binary tree 
          1
         / \
        2   3
       / \     
      4   5    
Returns [4, 5, 3], [2], [1].

Explanation:
1. Removing the leaves [4, 5, 3] would result in this tree:

          1
         / 
        2          
2. Now removing the leaf [2] would result in this tree:

          1          
3. Now removing the leaf [1] would result in the empty tree:

          []         
Returns [4, 5, 3], [2], [1].

Solution:
For this question we need to take bottom-up approach. The key is to find the height of each node. Here the definition of height is:
The height of a node is the number of edges from the node to the deepest leaf. --CMU 15-121 Binary Trees

I used a helper function to return the height of current node. According to the definition, the height of leaf is 0. h(node) = 1 + max(h(node.left), h(node.right)).
The height of a node is also the its index in the result list (res). For example, leaves, whose heights are 0, are stored in res[0]. Once we find the height of a node, we can put it directly into the result.

    private int height(TreeNode node, List<List<Integer>> res){
        if(null==node)  return -1;
        int level = 1 + Math.max(height(node.left, res), height(node.right, res));
        if(res.size()<level+1)  res.add(new ArrayList<>());
        res.get(level).add(node.val);
        return level;
    }
